This is some code to understand the basics to a web server and async Js using Node.js
Some people will just start using Express right away but it is important to understand what is going on in a web server.

Download [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Basic

In this file we have "hard coded" much of the web server, so we can understand the event loop and request cycle.

## Node-server

Here we will use [express](https://expressjs.com/) as a web server.
We have built out a server using templating engine ejs. It is built with the common MVC structure using the file system to store data. If you have ever built a Rails app this will look very similar so read this code base to get a feel for it and undertand it.
